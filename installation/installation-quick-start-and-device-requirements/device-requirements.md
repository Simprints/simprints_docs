{% hint style="warning" %}
Huawei Phones produced May 2019 onwards are not recommended (e.g. Huawei P40, Mate 30 series, Mate Xs and Honor 30 series).

Due to Google’s revocation of Huawei’s Android license, these devices do not support Google Play Store, which prohibits the installation and update of Simprints ID via Play Store.
