# Simprints ID (SID)

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page is still a work in progress.

Simprints ID has been designed to work in tandem with data collection applications. Therefore, the main execution flows are triggered not by the launcher intent but by an implicit intent from those applications. More information about the intent contract can be found on [LibSimprints](https://github.com/Simprints/LibSimprints) page.

In addition to the biometric flows, SID has a dashboard screen that is available from the launcher icon. This dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the current data synchronisation status, options to force data upload and minor application configuration options (project configuration is done on the backend).
