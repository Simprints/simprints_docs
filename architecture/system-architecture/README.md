# System architecture

### System Architecture <a href="#h.3m2wnttoawgt" id="h.3m2wnttoawgt"></a>

Our Simprints architecture falls into the following main elements:

### [**Mobile**](mobile/)

* [Simprints ID](mobile/simprints-id-sid/) (known as SID)
* Caller application (for example [SID Intents Launcher](../../product-overview/product-overview/sid-intents-launcher.md))
* Vero Fingerprint Scanner

### Cloud

Simprints maintains a cloud infrastructure that enables key operations to allow our platform to produce the best results. Our backend handles the configuration of our projects, data storage of biometrics and analytics, syncing across devices, and maintains interoperability and top levels of security. _(Not currently open source)_
