# Open Source Contributions

* We have created an initial and unmaintained version of a standalone version of SID which allows users to implement SID in a single use setting without reliance on BFSID or SDKs with license requirements. Check out his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Simprints/standalone-sid-alpha) to access the project & for a full description of the work.&#x20;
