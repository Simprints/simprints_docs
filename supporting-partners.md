Simprints leverages Testiny as its test management solution to streamline manual testing for their open-source Simprint ID Android application. This tool keeps all test cases organized and facilitates collaboration. Testiny's integrations with Jira and GitHub allow for a smooth workflow where defects discovered during testing can be easily reported and tracked, and code changes can be efficiently linked to specific test cases.&#x20;
