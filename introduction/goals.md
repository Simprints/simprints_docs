# Goals

We are establishing a collaborative space which fosters diverse participation, and emphasises impact measurement and scalability. Our Open Source goals significantly contribute to Simprints' mission of transforming global development and fighting poverty effectively.

We have set 3 goals for this initial phase

1. **Open Source Collaboration Hub:** Establish a collaborative platform or hub that fosters open-source development, encouraging developers, technologists, and experts worldwide to contribute their skills and knowledge. Our Github code, discussions and projects will serve as a centralised space for sharing ideas, code, resources, and best practices, facilitating innovation in technology solutions aimed at improving transparency and effectiveness in global development.
2. **Encouraging the adoption and adaptation of our solutions:**by partners and collaborators to amplify their impact at the last mile, ensuring that vaccines, funding, and essential services reach the most underserved populations efficiently and transparently.
3. **Engage Diverse Stakeholders:** We encourage active participation and engagement from a diverse range of stakeholders, including developers, NGOs, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and community members from different regions and backgrounds. Over time we plan to organise virtual hackathons, workshops, and forums to stimulate discussions, solicit feedback, and co-create innovative solutions that address the specific needs and challenges faced by partners like Gavi, Ghana Health Services, CIFF, and the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia.
4. **Impact Measurement and Scalability:** We will focus on measuring the impact of open-source contributions and technology implementations within the community. In time we will develop metrics and frameworks to assess the effectiveness and scalability of the technology solutions in real-world settings.&#x20;

By establishing a collaborative space, fostering diverse participation, and emphasising impact measurement and scalability, the open source community can significantly contribute to Simprints' mission of transforming global development and fighting poverty effectively.
