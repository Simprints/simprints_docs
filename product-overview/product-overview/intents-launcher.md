# Intents Launcher

{% hint style="info" %}
Release Q1 2024
{% endhint %}

Intents Launcher is an app that simulates a [calling app](data-collection-platforms/) for testing.&#x20;

The main purpose of the app is to ask SID to do something and take a look at the responses we get. The process creates a call to SID (the action) and passes some parameters (the **key-values**).
