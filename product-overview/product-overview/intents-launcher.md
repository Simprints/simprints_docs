# Intents Launcher

Intents Launcher is an app that simulates the calling app for testing. The main purpose of the app is to ask SID to do something and take a look at the responses we get. The process works by creating a call to SID (the **action**) and passing some parameters (the **key-values**).

The app is an easy way to create intents, add a bunch of extras and look at the returned code and extras. We get the returned bundle and parse it to a JSON so it's easy to see the return.
