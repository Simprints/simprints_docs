# Simprints ID (SID)

Simprints ID is our Android mobile application that enables a field worker to enrol, identify or verify a beneficiary using their biometrics. Simprints ID is a standalone application but can be easily integrated to any data collection platform. It can be used when offline or online, enabling field workers to reach beneficiaries in some of the most remote settings.

## What it does <a href="#h.d3x4lytd48gf_l" id="h.d3x4lytd48gf_l"></a>

* **Links a beneficiary’s record to their biometrics and subsequently id/verify in follow-up visits:** The field worker will use Simprints ID to capture the patient’s biometric information. A unique identifier will be generated to link the patient’s record (stored in the data collection app) to their uniquely identifiable biometric data (stored by Simprints). That enrolment will make it easy to use our biometric technology to identify the beneficiary during follow-up visits.
* **Ability to use biometrics offline:** Simprints ID allows the field worker to store data locally on the device when they are in the field without the need to connect to online servers. Storing the biometric templates locally will allow the field worker to enrol new beneficiaries and identify existing ones. When the field worker is within mobile data/Wi-Fi range, the user can sync to the Simprints Cloud database, to update records on their device and send data to the Cloud database.
* **Enabling field workers secure access to collect biometrics:** Privacy and security is integral at Simprints. When Simprints connects with partner applications, a series of authentication and verification steps occur to ensure that Simprints ID is being used securely and that the Android device is not compromised. In addition, whenever a field worker uses Simprints ID, both the field worker and beneficiary have the ability to provide consent to data collection when using Simprints ID.
* **View Simprints performance via Simprints dashboard:** The dashboard enables a user to quickly review Simprints statistics. It prompts a user on the number of records on the device, records to be uploaded and downloaded to/from the Simprints Cloud. The user is also able to get Simprints activity data such as the scanner last used and when the last enrolment, identification or verification occurred.

* Matching speed: On average, 3000 templates per second (on a Samsung J5 matching speed is 3320 templates/second)
* Average time spent for enrolment of 2 fingers or to capture face biometrics: 20 - 25 seconds
