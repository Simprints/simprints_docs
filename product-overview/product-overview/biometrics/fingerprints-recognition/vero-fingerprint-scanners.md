# Vero Fingerprint Scanners

We have been developing our Vero product for over seven years specifically to meet the extreme demands of last mile health and humanitarian aid use cases.

Vero is handheld and wireless, making it convenient for field workers to use. The scanner connects to Android devices via Bluetooth; there is no need for physical connection and issues with wire trips and disconnection. Data capture and matching can be done offline, therefore removing the need for Wi-Fi or data connectivity in rural settings. The device is water-resistant, shockproof and dust-resistant, making it robust in tough environments (IP65 rating).

**Vero collects a good quality beneficiary’s fingerprint template:** A field worker scans a beneficiary’s finger using Vero. The scanner checks the quality of the fingerprint image, and if it is of low quality, it prompts the field worker to retake the scan. Vero generates a unique fingerprint template (a string of numbers) and transmits the template to Simprints ID (via Bluetooth). Vero 2.0 can capture and transmit the image as well as the template.

**Vero has a flexible and interoperable system:** Fingerprint templates extracted using Vero are based on ISO template standards. This means that Simprints is interoperable with other biometric systems. For example, if a client had fingerprint templates from a different provider that were ISO compliant, they would be able to transfer and integrate the data with Simprints. With the wide range of proprietary templates, it is critical that we also support image interoperability.
