# Fingerprints Recognition

**The fingerprint modality** is enabled via our flagship product, the [Vero scanner](vero-fingerprint-scanners.md). We have been developing this product for over seven years to meet the extreme demands of last-mile health and humanitarian aid use cases, with a design focus on accuracy, mobility and robustness.

Fingerprint recognition is essentially a digital version of the analogue process undertaken in law enforcement, using the scientifically established near uniqueness of fingerprint features to identify humans.

Widely implemented and understood in commercial applications, with historic usage across law enforcement and security applications. ISO standardised, making some Fingerprint templates interoperable between solutions.
