### What is Simprints' product? <a href="#h.vwsfrzbsg1n6_l" id="h.vwsfrzbsg1n6_l"></a>

Simprints' product comprises three main elements:

1. A modality - a mode of biometric capture, either Fingerprint or Facial recognition
2. An Android app - Simprints ID
3. A Server - A cloud-hosted back end

Each of these elements can be configured specifically to meet the needs of each project. Please talk to your Project Manager for more details.

The fingerprint modality is enabled via our flagship product, the Vero scanner. We have been developing this product for over seven years specifically to meet the extreme demands of last mile health and humanitarian aid use cases, with design focus on accuracy, mobility and robustness.

Vero is handheld and wireless, making it convenient for field workers to use. The scanner connects to Android devices via Bluetooth, thus no need for physical connection and issues with wire trips and disconnection. Data capture and matching can be done offline, therefore removing the need for Wi-Fi or data connectivity in rural settings. The device is water resistant, shockproof and dust resistant making it robust in tough environments (IP65 rating).

**Vero collects a good quality beneficiary’s fingerprint template:** A field worker scans a beneficiary’s finger using Vero. The scanner checks the quality of the fingerprint image, and if it is a low quality prompts the field worker to retake the scan. Vero generates a unique fingerprint template (string of numbers) and transmits the template to Simprints ID (via Bluetooth). Vero 2.0 can capture and transmit the image as well as the template.

**Vero has a flexible and interoperable system:** Fingerprint templates extracted using Vero is based on ISO template standards. This means that Simprints is interoperable with other biometric systems. For example, if a client had fingerprint templates from a different provider that were ISO compliant, they will be able to transfer and integrate the data with Simprints. With the wide range of proprietary templates it is critical that we can also support image interoperability, which is now offered in Vero 2.0.

These are two generations of Vero available:

Vero 1.0

Available in projects live before 2020. For more information, please read through the [Vero 1.0 data sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nRkhoeBllyDEBLO94\_8Tj7lLB1PDg-6Y/view?usp=sharing).

Vero 2.0

Available in projects from 2020 onwards. For more information, please read through the [Vero 2.0 data sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tndWv\_yAycgreNMUxrsRxpU2S8wr87Bn/view?usp=sharing).

### Facial Recognition Modality <a href="#h.eartzwxzqc3r_l" id="h.eartzwxzqc3r_l"></a>

The facial recognition modality is enabled within our Simprints ID app, using the camera hardware within the Android device used. The facial recognition algorithm has been extensively tested to ensure it can perform to a high standard in the extreme conditions of the last mile, with a variety of populations.

**The device's camera captures a good quality image of a face:** A field worker captures a beneficiary’s face image using the device's built in camera, following the on-screen prompts to ensure the beneficiary is situated the correct distance from the lens and in good lighting. The face recognition algorithm checks the quality of the face image, and if it is a low quality prompts the field worker to retake the photo. The face recognition algorithm generates a unique face template (string of numbers) which is stored on the phone until it is synced to the Cloud.
