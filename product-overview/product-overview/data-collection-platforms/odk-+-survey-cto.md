# ODK + Survey CTO

Simprints ID can be integrated into any ODK-based platform. Make sure you have checked out our [Quick Start Guide](../../../installation/installation-quick-start-and-device-requirements/quick-start-guide.md) page before continuing.

An ODK XML form can collect information about a beneficiary over time. Within an ODK XML form, there is functionality to integrate the Simprints ID app. This will allow frontline workers to scan and capture a beneficiary's biometric records.

In some contexts, asking to scan peopleâ€™s fingerprints can be unfamiliar and intimidating, leading to some beneficiaries refusing to be scanned. When building an ODK form, we recommend that the question that asks for fingerprint scanning should come much later in the workflow, after other basic demographic information has been collected, to build up some comfort level for the user about the process and warm them up to providing consent for their fingerprints to be scanned.

In this guide, we will show you how to integrate your ODK enrollment/registration or verification form with Simprints ID. The sample forms we use in this guide are the bare minimum that a form should have, and in real-case scenarios, your forms will likely have more content than what is shown in this guide.
