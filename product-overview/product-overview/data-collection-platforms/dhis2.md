# DHIS2

DHIS2 is an open source data collection platform, built by the University of Oslo (UiO). They have a strong [community](https://community.dhis2.org/) supported by [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/2.34/en/dhis2\_android\_implementation\_guideline/about-this-guide.html) on how DHIS2 works. Their source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/dhis2) (including a skeleton Android app). If you want to learn more about how DHIS2 works they offer a [free course](https://academy.dhis2.org/courses/course-v1:HISP\_UiO+DHIS2\_101+2020\_Q4/about).

Our goal is for **Simprints ID to be integrated into the core platform**, so that anybody using DHIS2 can also use biometrics in their project (subject to commercial agreements being in place with us).

DHIS2 works across desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
