# DHIS2

DHIS2 is an open source data collection platform, built by the University of Oslo (UiO). They have a strong [community](https://community.dhis2.org/) supported by [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/2.34/en/dhis2\_android\_implementation\_guideline/about-this-guide.html) on how DHIS2 works. Their source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/dhis2) (including a skeleton Android app). If you want to learn more about how DHIS2 works they offer a [free course](https://academy.dhis2.org/courses/course-v1:HISP\_UiO+DHIS2\_101+2020\_Q4/about).

Integration of **Simprints ID** within **DHIS2** adds a powerful layer of biometric verification to the platform. With the available fork of the DHIS2 tracker mobile application, integrating Simprints has never been more straightforward.

After installing the application onto your devices, you can enjoy the following biometrics capabilities with Simprints ID:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Enrol</strong></td><td>Enroll beneficiaries and linking their records to biometric identifiers.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Identify</strong></td><td>Identify and find a beneficiary from his biometrics and not only his biographic data.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Verify</strong></td><td>In the detail page of a beneficiary, verify his biometrics against biometrics taken during enrollment.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Identification before enrol</strong></td><td>Start a biometric identification and continue with an enrolment without retaking biometrics if the beneficiary is not found during identification.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1"><strong>Enrol+</strong></a></td><td>When enrolling someone, check that there is not already a similar enrolment in the database to avoid duplicates.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Integrating Simprints with DHIS2 has already seen **success across** **several production-level projects**, leveraging the combined strengths of both platforms to ensure secure and efficient identification and data collection processes. This partnership highlights the practical and scalable application of biometrics in global health and development initiatives.

[Our goal is for **Simprints ID to be integrated into the core platform** at some point, so that anybody using DHIS2 can also use biometrics in their project (subject to commercial agreements being in place with us).](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

DHIS2 works across desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
