CommCare can work offline on Android phones and tablets. CommCare HQ is CommCare's server where a project manager will be able to design the data collection forms, whilst the CommCare app will allow a frontline worker to download the forms and start managing a beneficiary's case,

Simprints integrates with CommCare, allowing frontline workers to enrol and link a beneficiary's record to their biometrics. This will allow frontline workers to easily identify beneficiaries using their biometrics over time on follow-up appointments.
