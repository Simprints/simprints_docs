# Enrolment

In a typical deployment, an Attendant or User will initially carry out a process referred to as enrolment to register the subject into a biometric database at the beginning of the activity or endeavour - enabling the subsequent re-identification of the subject, for instance when they receive assistance.&#x20;

As a specialist task with various failure modes and requiring distinct troubleshooting steps, this enrolment process should typically be carried out independently from service delivery or under closer supervision. It may involve collection of or crossreferencing against other data, such as name, government ID, temporary documents, and other demographic data.
