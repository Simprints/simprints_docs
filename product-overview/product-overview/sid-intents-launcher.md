# SID Intents Launcher

{% hint style="info" %}
Released Q1 2024
{% endhint %}

[SID Intents Launcher](https://github.com/Simprints/SID-Intent-Launcher) is an app that simulates a [calling app](data-collection-platforms/) for testing.&#x20;

The app's primary purpose is to ask SID to do something and look at the responses we get. It also serves as the reference implementation of [LibSimprints](https://github.com/Simprints/LibSimprints).&#x20;

Since it is a development tool, there are no plans to make an official Play Store version. Instead, it is intended to be side-loaded onto the device. The latest version of the tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Simprints/SID-Intent-Launcher/releases).&#x20;
