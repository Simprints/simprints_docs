# Responsible Use

At Simprints, we are committed to empowering individuals and communities through the ethical and responsible use of biometric identification. We believe biometrics can be vital in improving access to essential services, protecting individuals from fraud and abuse, and promoting social inclusion. Data protection by design and default is baked into the core of our work with technology that is built to safeguard people's individual privacy.
