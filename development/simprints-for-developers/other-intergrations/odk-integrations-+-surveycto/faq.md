### Can I customise the launch button names? <a href="#h.p__e0c8kloem3c_l" id="h.p__e0c8kloem3c_l"></a>

In ODK you can customise the Simprints launch button names. Please get in touch with your Simprints project manager for more information

### Can I have an identification and verification within the same form? <a href="#h.p_0hw44d0agsfp_l" id="h.p_0hw44d0agsfp_l"></a>

At the moment, it is not possible to have an identification and verification in the same ODK form, as there are overlaps between the identification and verification question labels. ODK only allows for unique labels within a form, so you will not be able to compile a form with both identification and verification.

Simprints is aware of this and are working towards a solution.
