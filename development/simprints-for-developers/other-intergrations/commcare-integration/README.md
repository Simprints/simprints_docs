### What is CommCare? <a href="#h.p_nbgtqeoti8gp_l" id="h.p_nbgtqeoti8gp_l"></a>

### [CommCare](https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/) <a href="#h.p_ngjzzhtd671i_l" id="h.p_ngjzzhtd671i_l"></a>

CommCare is a data collection platform that frontline workers can use to collect, track and manage a beneficiary's case over time. CommCare can work offline on Android phones and tablets. CommCare HQ is CommCare's server where a project manager will be able to design the data collection forms whilst the CommCare app will allow a frontline worker to download the forms and start managing a beneficiary's case,

Simprints integrates with CommCare to provide frontline workers with the ability to enrol and link a beneficiary's record to their biometrics. This will allow for a frontline worker to easily identify a beneficiary using their biometrics over time on follow-up appointments.
